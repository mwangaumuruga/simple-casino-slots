"""trying to understand the basic working of a slot machine and the
first concept that has sunk is that it uses a random number generator to produce some output
then compares input with what the user had predicted to produce the result if the user has won or lost
it the multiplies the win  with the bet amount to show the winnings of the user.
yesterday just learnt to avoid predictability the code can run the random generator function over 100 times 
awarding each set some points to ensure its not so predictable and finally produce output"""
"""the code has three modules -first there is the   MONEY MANAGEMENT MODULE that ensures  the user balance is stakable,
                            subtracted after a loss and added after a win.It also ensures the staked amount and the deposited 
                            amount is updated on each input
                            -the second module is the slot. THE SLOT MODULE  has first the symbols of that will spin which are then 
                              used by the random function to produce a set of conjoining random slots which are used to show if the 
                              output is a win or a loss
                            -the third module combines the user choices on the slots and then code randomness
                            which are the combined to show the outcome
                            -then is a module for controls by the user which helps continue quit or get outs of the 
                            execution if you are ot of balance
                            -after this the computer simalates some dummies to ensure we can get illussion or simulation of what is 
                            happenning


SUMMARY OF THE TASKS
function to simulate the slots
function determine winnings
loop to ensure the customer keeps on playing untill he stops or losses all the loot
ensure redudancy by the use points
